### Requirements
- server side of the project written in `Golang`, hence an installation of Golang is in order to _build_ server.
- suggested version for Golang is v1.11.

### Local development
- running `go run main.go` should serve app on **localhost:8080**.

###Â Deployment
- run `go build` to generate an executable of the project
- `res` folder should be present in the same directory with executable

<br>

### optionals
- you can fill out `url` variable in `test.html` for the web ui to point to a server.
- as system can be configured to directly serve at :80, Nginx setup is optional
- an entry to run the executable as daemon process can be configured
